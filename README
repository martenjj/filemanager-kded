File Manager Redirector for Plasma
==================================

This addon attempts to address a longstanding anomaly with the Plasma
desktop and its file manager applications.  As described in
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=397953, launching a file manager,
for example by opening an image folder from the screen capture utility
Spectacle, always uses the Dolphin file manager if it is installed.
This will happen even if the user has configured another file manager
such as Konqueror or Nautilus as their preferred application.

As described in the bug report, this happens because if Dolphin is
installed it registers itself to be launched for the
org.freedesktop.FileManager1 DBus service.  This service is used by
applications when they wish to start a file manager, but unfortunately
it ignores the user's configuration.  Having other file managers, in
particular Nautilus, installed may override Dolphin or may not,
unpredictably.

This module overrides those file managers by registering itself for
that service at Plasma startup.  When it receives a request to open a
file manager, it finds the user's preferred file manager (which the
highest priority service registered for the inode/directory MIME type),
and launches that with appropriate options.  The DBus service registration
for Dolphin or any other file manager installed is ignored.

This works for Dolphin and Konqueror, and should in theory work for
Nautilus or any other file manager which supports the "--mimetype" and
"--select" command line options.  Konqueror has to be a special case
because the normal "kfmclient" command to launch it does not support
those options, but using the "konqueror" command directly does.

Build and install from source in the usual way - to build for a specific
Plasma/Frameworks version set the QT_MAJOR_VERSION option to CMake.  Then
log out and log in again to ensure that the module is loaded.  Set your
preferred file manager in System Settings - Apps & Windows - Default
Applications.
